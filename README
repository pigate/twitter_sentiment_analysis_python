Still need to determine which state is the happiest.
Going to start with...

Dictionary of states (only 50 nodes. not too bad): (Sentiment Rating, tweet counts)

If can determine state of the tweeter:
  Determine sentiment of a tweet.
  Update dictionary with tweet sentiment value (compute avg?)

Flip out the dictionary such that
  get new dict with 
    sentiment rating: [state1, state2...]

Our sentiment:state_array dict is in asc. order so,
  we grab the last 10 or so and reverse this bunch
  print out up to 10 of the states. --> happiest 10 states!
